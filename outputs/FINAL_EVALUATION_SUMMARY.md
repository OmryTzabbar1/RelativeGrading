# Student Project Evaluation - Final Results

**Evaluation Date:** 2025-12-23  
**Total Students:** 13 (excluded 2 students with wrong assignments)  
**Total Criteria Discovered:** 95  
**Criteria After Grouping:** 95 (4 grouped into general categories)  

## Excluded Students

- **87687:** Submitted LSTM frequency extraction project (Assignment 2, not 4)
- **87692:** Submitted Ollama chat interface (not a route guide system)

## Grading Methodology

### Base Scoring
- Each criterion weighted by prevalence (count / total_students)
- Student score = sum of weights for criteria they have
- Base percentage = (student_score / max_possible_weight) × 100
- Max possible weight: 20.57

### Rarity Bonuses
- Criteria with ≤15% prevalence (≤2 students) earn +1 bonus point
- Rewards students who went above and beyond common requirements
- Final score capped at 100
