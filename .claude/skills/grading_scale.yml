# Student Project Grading Scale
# Documentation and Quality Focused Evaluation Framework
# Version: 1.0

grading_philosophy: |
  All projects should have documentation, research, graphics, and planning.
  Grades differentiate based on the QUALITY and DETAIL level of these elements.
  Most students should fall in the 75-85 range for solid work.

# Grading Guidelines
guidelines:
  baseline_calibration: |
    When establishing baseline grade:
    1. Read all documentation (README, planning docs, etc.)
    2. Assess research quality and relevance
    3. Count and evaluate visual elements
    4. Review planning and design rationale
    5. Evaluate code quality and completeness
    6. Place in appropriate grade range based on above criteria

  comparative_evaluation: |
    When comparing students to baseline:
    1. Compare documentation quantity and quality
    2. Compare research depth and relevance
    3. Compare visual elements (more/fewer, better/worse quality)
    4. Compare planning detail and clarity
    5. Compare implementation completeness
    6. Adjust grade up/down based on relative quality

  adjustment_scale: |
    From baseline grade, adjust:
    - Documentation significantly better: +5 to +10 points
    - Documentation moderately better: +2 to +5 points
    - Documentation similar: 0 points
    - Documentation moderately worse: -2 to -5 points
    - Documentation significantly worse: -5 to -10 points

    Apply similar logic for research, graphics, planning, implementation.
    Final adjustment should reflect overall relative quality.

# Red Flags (automatic grade penalties)
red_flags:
  - flag: "No README"
    penalty: "Major (place in 0-65 range)"

  - flag: "No documentation beyond README"
    penalty: "Significant (max 75)"

  - flag: "No research when required by assignment"
    penalty: "Significant (max 75)"

  - flag: "No screenshots/visuals"
    penalty: "Moderate (max 85)"

  - flag: "No planning documentation"
    penalty: "Moderate (max 85)"

  - flag: "Incomplete implementation"
    penalty: "Variable (based on severity)"

# Notes
notes:
  - "Most students should fall in 75-85 range for solid work"
  - "95-100 is reserved for truly exceptional projects"
  - "All projects should have documentation, research, graphics, planning"
  - "Grades reflect QUALITY and DETAIL level, not just presence/absence"
  - "Comparative grading means relative to baseline and peers"
