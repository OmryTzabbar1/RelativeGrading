## Grading Methodology

### Base Score Calculation
```
Base Score = (sum of weighted criteria student has) / (total possible weight) × 100
Max possible weight: 12.81 (sum of all criterion weights)
```

### Rarity Bonus System
Students receive +1 point for each criterion with ≤15% prevalence (≤5 students)

**Rationale:** Rewards students who implemented rare/distinguishing features beyond common requirements

### Final Score
```
Final Score = Base Score + Sum of Rarity Bonuses (capped at 100)
```

## Capabilities-Based Extraction

Following the updated EXTRACTION.md rules, this evaluation focused on **capabilities accomplished** rather than **technology choices**:

### ✅ What We Extracted (Capabilities)
- Frontend implementation (not "React" or "Vue")
- Backend API (not "FastAPI" or "Express")
- Database integration (not "PostgreSQL" or "MongoDB")
- Testing infrastructure (unit, integration, coverage)
- Documentation artifacts (PRD, Architecture, API docs)
- Error handling and data validation
- Configuration management

### ❌ What We Did NOT Extract (Tech Choices)
- "Built with React"
- "Powered by FastAPI"
- "Uses PostgreSQL"
- "Written in Python"
- Specific library/framework names

**Result:** Fair comparison where students using different tech stacks to achieve the same capabilities are evaluated equally.

## Improvement Recommendations

### For Top Performers (90%+)
Already demonstrating excellence. Consider:
- Publishing case studies or tutorials
- Mentoring other students
- Contributing to open-source projects

### For Strong Performers (70-89%)
Solid foundation. Next level:
- Add API documentation
- Include security considerations
- Document deployment procedures
- Add use case documentation

### For Middle Performers (50-69%)
Good start. Focus on:
- Complete architecture documentation
- Add installation instructions
- Improve test coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Document data validation approaches

### For Low Performers (<50%)
Need significant improvement:
1. **Priority 1:** Add basic documentation (README, PRD)
2. **Priority 2:** Implement testing (unit tests + coverage)
3. **Priority 3:** Document architecture and usage
4. **Priority 4:** Add error handling and validation
