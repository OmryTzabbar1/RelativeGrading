## Impact of Smart Consolidation

### Before Consolidation (95 detailed criteria):
- Student 87694: 92.3 grade (51 criteria, +26 bonus)
- Separate credit for Black, Ruff, ESLint, MyPy, Type Hints, Pydantic

### After Consolidation (45 grouped criteria):
- Student 87694: 87.0 grade (31 criteria, +7 bonus)
- Combined into "Code Quality Tools" (1 criterion)

**Result:** Fairer comparison based on capabilities, not tool proliferation
